## Description

- This is a Windows Forms product list maker that has a background image and two main forms as view pages, in which you can list as many products as you like. Also, it plays a pop song to make you feel better, enjoy!

## How to start

- In order to start the game, you must have Visual Studio installed with Windows Forms package

## About the code

- It's a pretty simple winforms code in which we only have an entity class called Product, that contains all the products data to be used in the forms, as you can see below.

- When we fill the fields with the products data, then it's only about to pick these data up and bring them to a new Product list item that will be applied on a new form to appear over the screen

## TODO

- When I started this project I was wondering about the possibility to implement some kind of a CRUD within it, which could allow us to use a login system, as it is already shown on the first form. Once the user create a registry, it should be used to let the user directly into a previous or even saved list of products.
